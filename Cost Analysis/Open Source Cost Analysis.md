## Cost Analysis:

| Original Architecture Component     | New Architecture Component | Analysis                                                |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| OpenAI API                         | Hugging Face Transformers   | Original architecture incurred costs for API usage, while the new architecture involves lower costs for model training.                               |
| Airflow on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) | Luigi                      | Original architecture included hosting costs for Airflow on GCP, while the new architecture uses Luigi, which is free and open-source, potentially reducing orchestration costs.           |
| Streamlit                          | Vue.js (User Interface)     | Both architectures involve development costs for building and maintaining the user interface, but Vue.js is lightweight and open-source, possibly resulting in cost savings.  |
| FastAPI                            | Flask (Backend Services)    | Development costs for backend services in both architectures, with Flask offering simplicity and flexibility as a lightweight, open-source framework.                       |
| PostgreSQL                         | MongoDB (Database)         | Original architecture included hosting costs for PostgreSQL, while the new architecture uses MongoDB, which may offer a free tier for smaller applications, potentially reducing costs.  |
| Heroku                             | Not Used                   | Original architecture hosted components on Heroku, while the new architecture does not use Heroku, potentially reducing hosting costs.                                |
| User and Logs Tables in PostgreSQL | Not Used                   | In the new architecture, user and logs tables from PostgreSQL are not used, potentially reducing database hosting costs.                                                |
| Monitoring Tools (GCP, Heroku)     | Prometheus / Grafana       | Original architecture incurred costs for integrated monitoring tools, while the new architecture uses Prometheus and Grafana, which are free and open-source, potentially reducing monitoring costs. |
| Total Cost                         | Total Cost                 | The new architecture has the potential to reduce overall costs due to the use of open-source tools, free tiers, and simplified components.                                           |

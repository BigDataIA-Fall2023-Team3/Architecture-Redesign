## Cost Analysis:

| Original Architecture Component     | New Architecture Component | Analysis                                                |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| OpenAI API                         | Hugging Face Transformers   | Original architecture incurred costs for API usage, while the new architecture involves lower costs for model training.                               |
| Airflow on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) | Luigi                      | Original architecture included hosting costs for Airflow on GCP, while the new architecture uses Luigi, which is free and open-source, potentially reducing orchestration costs.           |
| Streamlit                          | Vue.js (User Interface)     | Both architectures involve development costs for building and maintaining the user interface, but Vue.js is lightweight and open-source, possibly resulting in cost savings.  |
| FastAPI                            | Flask (Backend Services)    | Development costs for backend services in both architectures, with Flask offering simplicity and flexibility as a lightweight, open-source framework.                       |
| PostgreSQL                         | MongoDB (Database)         | Original architecture included hosting costs for PostgreSQL, while the new architecture uses MongoDB, which may offer a free tier for smaller applications, potentially reducing costs.  |
| Heroku                             | Not Used                   | Original architecture hosted components on Heroku, while the new architecture does not use Heroku, potentially reducing hosting costs.                                |
| User and Logs Tables in PostgreSQL | Not Used                   | In the new architecture, user and logs tables from PostgreSQL are not used, potentially reducing database hosting costs.                                                |
| Monitoring Tools (GCP, Heroku)     | Prometheus / Grafana       | Original architecture incurred costs for integrated monitoring tools, while the new architecture uses Prometheus and Grafana, which are free and open-source, potentially reducing monitoring costs. |
| Total Cost : Moderate                        | Total Cost: Low                 | The new architecture has the potential to reduce overall costs due to the use of open-source tools, free tiers, and simplified components.                                           |


### Comparison:

Based on the information provided and the cost analysis table, the original architecture appears to have higher overall costs compared to the new architecture. Here's a summary of the cost comparison:
#### Original Architecture: 
Incurred costs for OpenAI API usage, hosting on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), hosting on Heroku, and integrated monitoring tools on GCP and Heroku.
#### New Architecture: 
Utilizes more open-source and cost-effective components, including Hugging Face Transformers for NLP (with potential lower costs for model training), Luigi for workflow orchestration, Vue.js and Flask for the user interface and backend services, MongoDB for the database (potentially with a free tier), and Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring (free and open-source).

#### While the specific costs may vary depending on usage and scale, the new architecture is designed to reduce costs compared to the original architecture by leveraging open-source tools and platforms with potentially lower hosting and usage expenses.

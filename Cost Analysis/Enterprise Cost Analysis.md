|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OpenAI API                           | Hugging Face Transformers        | Original architecture incurred costs for OpenAI API usage, while the new architecture involves lower costs for model training.            |
| Airflow on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) | AWS Step Functions              | Original architecture included hosting costs for Airflow on GCP, while the new architecture uses AWS Step Functions for efficient workflow orchestration.                                                |
| Streamlit                            | Azure Web App, Azure Load Balancer | Both architectures involve development costs for building and maintaining user interfaces, with Azure Web App offering scalability and Azure Load Balancer ensuring optimal traffic distribution.         |
| FastAPI                              | Azure Web App                    | Development costs for backend services in both architectures, with Azure Web App serving as a scalable and efficient hosting solution.  |
| PostgreSQL                           | Azure SQL Database               | Original architecture included hosting costs for PostgreSQL on GCP, while the new architecture uses Azure SQL Database for data storage, incurring hosting costs for robust data storage capabilities. |
| Heroku                               | Not Used                         | Original architecture hosted components on Heroku, while the new architecture does not use Heroku, potentially reducing hosting costs.     |
| User and Logs Tables in PostgreSQL   | Not Used                         | In the new architecture, user and logs tables from PostgreSQL are not used, potentially reducing database hosting costs.                 |
| Monitoring Tools (GCP, Heroku)       | Snowflake, Elasticsearch Stack, Grafana, Microsoft Teams | Original architecture incurred costs for integrated monitoring tools, while the new architecture uses Snowflake, Elasticsearch Stack, Grafana, and Microsoft Teams for analytics and monitoring.         |
| Total Cost                           | Total Cost                      | The new architecture may result in potential cost savings due to the use of efficient cloud services and the removal of certain components, but the actual cost impact would depend on specific usage patterns and configurations.                                                                                                                                                               |



### Comparison:

#### Based on the provided cost analysis, the original architecture appears to have higher overall costs compared to the new architecture. Here are some key reasons for this assessment:

#### Original Architecture Components:
- OpenAI API: Incurs costs for API usage.
- Airflow on Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Involves hosting costs.
- Heroku: Incurs hosting costs for components.
- PostgreSQL: Hosting costs on GCP.
- Monitoring Tools (GCP, Heroku): Incurs costs for integrated monitoring tools.

#### New Architecture Components:
- NLP API Processing: Involves costs for API usage (Google Cloud's Natural Language API).
- Data Storage: Azure SQL Database incurs hosting costs.
- Monitoring Tools (Snowflake, Elasticsearch Stack, Grafana, Microsoft Teams): While these components are used for monitoring, they are typically considered more cost-effective or offer free/open-source options compared to the original monitoring tools.
- Additionally, the new architecture leverages cloud services like Azure Web App, Azure Load Balancer, and AWS Step Functions, which can offer scalability and cost optimization compared to hosting components on platforms like GCP and Heroku.

#### However, it's important to note that the actual cost impact depends on various factors, including usage patterns, data volumes, and specific configurations. To determine precise cost differences, a detailed cost analysis based on real-world usage and pricing considerations would be required.
